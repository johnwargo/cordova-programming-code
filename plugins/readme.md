This folder contains the two plugins described in Chapter 13. 

The mol folder contains the Meaning of Life plugin which is a JavaScript-only plugin that calculates the Meaning of Life (the "Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything" from Douglas Adams' Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy simplified by me to Meaning of Life)

The Carrier plugin is a native plugin for Android and iOS which exposes some simple telephony APIs to a Cordova application.

Sample applications that exercise the plugins can be found in the Chapter 13 folder. The Simple Plugin example exercises the MoL plugin and the Native Plugin example exercises the Carrier plugin.
